# Tracking User Behavior and Acquisition to Increase Pageviews

## Business Problem
Over the last three years, Commit has created a catered, user-specific suite of over 200 data dashboards, curating them to the main dashboard website since 2019. The organization's initial goal was 30,000 views, which was surpassed in less than a year. Commit's mission is to democratize data while empowering and informing partners and decision-makers. Because this process is driven by public data and depends on partner or user asks, it is important to identify which dashboards are used the most. This will inform future dashboards while streamlining and optimizing how Commit responds, tracks, and acts based on user behavior.  

## About the Data 
Data was acquired using Google Analytics, which tracks user behavior and acquisition through the use of ad campaigns. The data consisted of thousands of records of historical usage data including geo-location, number of click-throughs, number of pageviews, and number of unique vs. total users. The visualization presented here is not an exhaustive use of the data, as there are many ways to present it depending on business need. 

Due to company policy, the live dashboard cannot be shared as it is intended for internal use. However, a static version is below.

## Outcomes 
This dashboard is able to capture user behavior any given time or date range and quantify how many users are accessing our suite of data dashboards. Not only can the tool identify the number of users, but it can identify their location, the day they viewed, and the time they viewed. This will allow Commit to identify the best day and time of day to release a new dashboard to increase user views. 

Employing the tool resulted in Commitâ€™s Tableau Gallery receiving an increase of 2,100 users and 8,000 page views as of December, 2020. A new subpage for curated dashboards based on the type of user (ex: schoolboard member) was also created.
